# AGENTS.md — AI-SDLC Router

Repository state lives in:

docs/TASKS.md

Maintain `docs/TASKS.md`: PHASE = selected phase; STATUS = ready, in-progress,
done or blocked. Set in-progress on entry, done only after the phase output is
verified, or blocked with a reason. Keep PHASE on completion; an explicitly
selected next phase starts as ready. Changes to this router require human review.

---

Phases may be **skipped or repeated**.

Typical iteration:

SPECIFY → DESIGN → DEVELOP → VALIDATE  
VALIDATE → SPECIFY (iteration)  
DEPLOY → SPECIFY (feedback)

---

## Fast Track

- Small corrections only; no feature, API, data, security, dependency or architecture changes.
- Record scope, reason, acceptance and checks in the existing UC or `docs/TASKS.md`.
- Shorten SPECIFY; skip DESIGN with a reason. Scope grows → regular flow.
- Keep required CI and review. Release/deployment still require authorization.
- Regression fixes start with a failing test; omitted checks are recorded with reasons.

## Collaboration

- Human-approved decisions → ADR; current architecture → `docs/PROJECT.md`.
- Durable rules + ADR links → `AGENTS.md`, with human approval/review.
- Update related files together; preserve decision history and reconcile parallel changes.
- ADRs start as Proposed. Only a named team member can accept one, with a review reference.

## Context Load Order

1. docs/TASKS.md
2. docs/PROJECT.md
3. docs/specs/UC-[NNN]-[NAME].md (or the eligible Fast Track task entry)
4. the skill for the current phase

## Phase → Skill

0 → skills/ai-sdlc-0-bootstrap  
1 → skills/ai-sdlc-1-specify  
2 → skills/ai-sdlc-2-design  
3 → skills/ai-sdlc-3-develop  
4 → skills/ai-sdlc-4-validate  
5 → skills/ai-sdlc-5-deploy

## Commands

Use the install, test, run and release commands in `docs/PROJECT.md`.

---

## Rules

- Use the language of the current user prompt for all communication and all
natural-language artifacts. Do not default to the language of earlier
messages.
- Update existing artifacts; create only what is missing.
- Keep artifacts **minimal**.
- Avoid unnecessary comments in code.
- Follow **TDD** (tests before code).
- Respect **Clean Architecture**  
domain ← application ← interfaces ← infrastructure
- `domain/` and `application/` never import FastAPI, Pydantic or SQLAlchemy.
- Any LLM or ERP call goes through its port in `application/ports/`.
- Prefer **small vertical slices** (one UC end-to-end).
- Read the [canonical AI-SDLC documentation](https://docs.aisl.science/learning-and-resources/ai-sdlc) when terminology or lifecycle responsibilities are unclear.

If requirements or architecture are unclear → ask the user.
